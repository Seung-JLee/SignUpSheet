# SignUpSheet

This is a Lab 2 Assignment for Mobile Application Development - CIS 3515.
The purpose of this assignment was to use different types of views and layouts to create a simple sign up sheet that would
collect the user's Name, E-mail, password and another slot to confirm the password. 

The program would check to see if all fields were filled out, and if not throws an error message.
Also throws another error message when the passwords do not match. 

If all the fields are filled out and the passwords match, then the application will clear all the information saved on 
each EditView, and will print out a message welcoming the user with the user's name.

The program could be a lot better in terms of visuals (font style, colors, background, layout dimensions), which might be
my motivation to come back to this program and make it look more asthetically pleasing. 

I began this assignment by setting up a vertical layout to place editviews and textviews on top of, and then proceeded to 
create a title textview, and then four edittexts to store the four fields needed. After having set those up, I then proceeded
to work on the main.java in order to properly implement the necessary functions of the application.

Screenshots are included to show the two types of errors, as well as a successful run result.
